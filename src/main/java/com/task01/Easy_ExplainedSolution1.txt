This code is a Java implementation of the "Two Sum" problem,
which is a classic algorithmic problem in computer science.
The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
 and you may not use the same element twice.

The code defines a class Solution1 with a method twoSum that takes an integer array nums
and an integer target as input and returns an integer array of length 2 containing
the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

The code uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the array
and checks if their sum is equal to the target.
If a pair of numbers is found that satisfies the condition,
their indices are returned as an array. If no such pair is found, the method returns null.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2),
where n is the length of the input array.
A follow-up question is posed at the end of the problem,
which asks if it is possible to come up with an algorithm that has a time complexity less than O(n^2).
