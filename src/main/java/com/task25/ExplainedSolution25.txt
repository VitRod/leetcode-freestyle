The problem asks to reverse every group of k nodes in a singly-linked list,
while preserving the order of the nodes in the list.
If there are fewer than k nodes left at the end of the list, these nodes should be left as is.

The solution uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the edge cases.
The idea is to maintain two pointers start and end, which mark the start and end of a group of k nodes.
The start pointer is initialized to the dummy node, and the end pointer is initialized to the head of the list.

The algorithm iterates through the list, counting the number of nodes visited so far.
When the count is a multiple of k, the group of k nodes is reversed using the reverse() method.
The reverse() method takes two arguments: the start pointer and the node after the end pointer.
It reverses the group of k nodes between the start and end pointers, and returns the new start pointer,
 which is the original end pointer of the group.

After reversing the group of k nodes, the start pointer is updated to the new start pointer returned
by the reverse() method, and the end pointer is updated to the node after the new start pointer.
If the end of the list is reached before a group of k nodes is found,
the loop ends and the modified list is returned.

The reverse() method reverses the group of k nodes between the start and end pointers.
It uses three pointers: prev, curr, and temp. The prev pointer initially points to the node before
the start pointer, and the curr pointer initially points to the node after the start pointer.
The temp pointer is used to store the next node to be visited.

The algorithm iterates through the group of k nodes, reversing the links between adjacent nodes.
When the end of the group is reached, the prev pointer is updated to point to the original end pointer,
and the start pointer is updated to the original curr pointer.
Finally, the reverse() method returns the new start pointer,
which is the original end pointer of the group.
