This is a Java code for solving the "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" problem.
The problem asks to find the median of two sorted arrays,
where the combined length of the arrays can be odd or even.
The solution needs to have a time complexity of O(log(m+n)).

The solution works by merging the two sorted arrays into a single sorted array,
 and then calculating the median based on the length of the merged array.
 The algorithm initializes three pointers, i, j, and k, where i and j
 are the index of nums1 and nums2 respectively, and k is the index of the merged array.

The solution then iterates through the two arrays, comparing the values at the i-th and j-th indices,
and adding the smaller one to the merged array. If both values are equal,
 it adds either one of them to the merged array.
 The iteration continues until one of the arrays has no more elements left.

After the first iteration, there may be some remaining elements in one of the arrays,
so the algorithm adds those elements to the end of the merged array. Finally,
the median is calculated based on the length of the merged array.
If the length is even, it calculates the average of the two middle elements.
If the length is odd, it returns the middle element.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m+n), which is not optimal.
However, it is still sufficient to solve the problem within the given constraints.
There are more efficient algorithms to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(log(m+n)),
which use binary search.
