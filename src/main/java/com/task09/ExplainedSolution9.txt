This is a Java code for solving the Palindrome Number problem.
The problem is to determine whether the given integer x is a palindrome or not.
 A palindrome number is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

The class name is "Solution9", and it has a public method named "isPalindrome".
This method takes an integer argument 'x'
and returns a boolean value indicating whether the integer is a palindrome or not.

The first condition in the code checks if the given integer is negative.
If it is, then the method returns false because a negative integer can never be a palindrome.

If the integer is not negative, the code creates a copy of the integer,
assigns it to the variable "copyX", and initializes a variable "reverse" to 0.
Then, a while loop runs until "copyX" is greater than 0. In each iteration,
the last digit of "copyX" is extracted using the modulus operator
and added to the "reverse" variable after multiplying it by 10.
Then, the last digit is removed from "copyX" by dividing it by 10.

After the loop completes, the "reverse" variable will contain the reversed integer.
Finally, the code checks if the original integer "x" is equal to the reversed integer "reverse".
If they are equal, the method returns true, indicating that the integer is a palindrome.
Otherwise, the method returns false.

The code satisfies the given constraints that the integer x can be as low as -231 and as high as 231-1.

This is a Java program that checks if a given integer is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome number is a number that reads the same backward as forwards, such as 121, 1221, 12321, etc.

The program defines a public class named Solution9,
which contains a method named isPalindrome that takes an integer x as its input
and returns a boolean value indicating whether x is a palindrome or not.

The method first checks if the given integer x is negative,
 as a negative integer cannot be a palindrome. If x is negative, the method returns false.

If x is positive or zero, the method creates a copy of x named copyX
and initializes a variable named reverse to 0.
It then enters a while loop that continues until copyX becomes 0.
In each iteration of the loop,
the program calculates the last digit of copyX using the modulo operator
and adds it to the reverse variable multiplied by 10.
It then divides copyX by 10 to remove the last digit.
This process effectively reverses the digits of x and stores them in reverse.

After the while loop terminates, the method checks if x is equal to reverse.
If they are equal, it returns true, indicating that x is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns false.

The program satisfies the constraint that
the input integer x can be within the range of -231 to 231 - 1.

 This is a Java code for the problem "Palindrome Number".
 The objective is to determine whether the input integer x is a palindrome or not.
  A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

 The code starts with a class named "Solution9".
 Within the class, there is a method named "isPalindrome" that takes an integer "x"
 as input and returns a boolean value.
 The "isPalindrome" method uses a simple algorithm to determine
  whether the input integer is a palindrome or not.

 The first check is to see if the input integer is negative.
 If it is, then it cannot be a palindrome, so the method immediately returns false.

 If the input integer is not negative,
 the method creates a copy of the input integer and stores it in a variable named "copyX".
  It also initializes a variable named "reverse" to zero.
  The algorithm then uses a while loop to reverse the digits of the input integer.

 The loop iterates as long as the value of "copyX" is greater than zero.
 In each iteration, the algorithm extracts the last digit of "copyX"
 using the modulo operator and adds it to the variable "reverse" multiplied by 10.
 This effectively shifts the digits of "reverse" one place to the left
  and adds the last digit of "copyX" as the new rightmost digit.
   The algorithm then removes the last digit of "copyX" using integer division.

 After the while loop is complete,
 the algorithm checks whether the reversed integer is equal to the original input integer.
  If they are equal, then the input integer is a palindrome, and the method returns true.
  If they are not equal, then the input integer is not a palindrome, and the method returns false.

 Finally, the code includes a set of constraints for the input integer.
 The input integer must be within the range of -231 to 231-1.
