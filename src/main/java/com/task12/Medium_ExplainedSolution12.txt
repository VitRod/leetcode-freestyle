The given code is a solution to the problem of converting an integer to its Roman numeral representation.
The code takes an integer 'num' as input and returns a string containing its Roman numeral representation.

The solution makes use of two arrays - 'values' and 'symbols'.
'values' array contains the integer values of all the Roman numerals from 1000 to 1,
and 'symbols' array contains the corresponding symbols of these values in Roman numerals.

The code iterates through the 'values' array and checks if the input integer 'num' is greater than
or equal to the current value in the array.
If it is, then the code subtracts the value from 'num'
and appends the corresponding symbol from the 'symbols' array to a StringBuilder 'sb'.
The loop continues until 'num' becomes zero.

Finally, the StringBuilder 'sb' is converted to a string and returned
as the Roman numeral representation of the input integer 'num'.

The solution works for all integers between 1 and 3999,
which are the constraints given in the problem statement.

  This is a Java code for the problem of converting an integer to a Roman numeral.
  The program defines a function called "intToRoman"
  which takes an integer as an input and returns the corresponding Roman numeral as a string.

  To convert the integer to a Roman numeral, the program uses two arrays: "values" and "symbols".
  The "values" array contains the numerical values of the Roman numerals in descending order,
  and the "symbols" array contains the corresponding symbols of the Roman numerals.

  The program then iterates through the "values" array using a for loop,
  and checks if the current value in the array is less than or equal to the input number.
  If it is, the program subtracts the value from the input number, and appends the corresponding symbol
  from the "symbols" array to a StringBuilder object called "sb".

  The program continues this process until the input number becomes zero,
   and then returns the final string representation of the Roman numeral
   by calling the "toString" method on the "sb" object.

    This code is a Java program that converts an integer into its corresponding Roman numeral representation.
    The program defines a public method called "intToRoman" that takes an integer as input
    and returns a String containing the corresponding Roman numeral.

    To perform the conversion, the program uses two arrays: "values" and "symbols".
    The "values" array contains the integer values of the Roman numerals in descending order.
    The "symbols" array contains the corresponding Roman numeral symbols in the same order.

    The program then iterates through the "values" array and checks if the input integer is greater than
    or equal to the current value in the array.
    If it is, the program subtracts the current value from the input integer
    and appends the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to a StringBuilder object.
     This process is repeated until the entire "values" array has been traversed.

    Finally, the program returns the StringBuilder object as a String containing
    the Roman numeral representation of the input integer.
