This is a Java program that defines a class Solution14 with a public method longestCommonPrefix
that takes an array of strings as input and returns a string.
The program finds the longest common prefix string among the array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, it returns an empty string.

The program first checks if the input array is empty or not.
If the array is empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise,
it initializes the result string with the first string in the array.

Then, it loops through all the strings in the input array.
For each string, it loops through the characters of the result string and the current string.
If the characters at the same index are not equal,
it cuts off the result string up to that index and breaks out of the loop.

Finally, it returns the result string, which is the longest common prefix among the input strings.

This code is a Java implementation of a solution to the "Longest Common Prefix" problem,
 which is a popular coding problem categorized as "Easy".
 The problem statement is to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

The code starts with a class named "Solution14".
It has a public method called "longestCommonPrefix" which takes an array of strings,
"strs", as input and returns a string as output.

The first line of the method checks for an edge case where the length of the input array "strs" is 0.
If this is the case, it returns an empty string "" as there is no common prefix among an empty array of strings.

The code then initializes a string variable called "result" with the first string in the input array "strs".
 This is done to have a base string to compare with other strings in the array.

The code then uses two nested loops to compare each character of the strings
 in the array with the characters in the "result" string.
  The outer loop iterates through each string in the array "strs",
  and the inner loop iterates through each character in the "result" string.

Inside the inner loop, it checks if the current index "j" is out of range for the current string "s"
or if the character at the current index "j" in the "result" string
is not equal to the character at the same index "j" in the current string "s".
If either of these conditions is true, it means that the common prefix has ended,
so the code cuts off the "result" string using the "substring" method from index 0 to index "j" (exclusive)
 to get the common prefix until that point.
 Then it breaks out of the inner loop to move on to the next string in the array.

The process continues for all strings in the array, and at the end of the loops,
the "result" string will contain the longest common prefix among all the strings in the input array.

Finally, the "result" string is returned as the output of the method,
which represents the longest common prefix among the input strings.
If there is no common prefix, the "result" string would be an empty string "".

This is Java code for solving the "Longest Common Prefix" problem.
The problem statement is to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string.

The code defines a class called "Solution14" which contains a public method
called "longestCommonPrefix" that takes an array of strings
as input and returns the longest common prefix string.

The method first checks if the array is empty,
in which case it returns an empty string.
If the array is not empty, it initializes the "result" string with the first string in the array.

The method then loops through all the strings in the array and for each string,
it loops through the characters in the "result" string.
If the character at the same position in the current string
is not equal to the character in the "result" string,
 or if the loop reaches the end of the current string,
 it cuts off the "result" string up to the current position and breaks out of the loop.

At the end of the loops, the method returns the "result" string,
which is the longest common prefix among all the strings in the array.
