This is a Java program that finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string s.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

The longestPalindrome method takes in a string s and returns the longest palindromic substring in s.
The method first checks if the length of s is less than or equal to 1. If it is,
it returns the original string s.

The method then converts the string to a character array using toCharArray() method,
which is more efficient for string manipulation.

Next, the method loops through the characters in the string
and calls the helper function helper(chars, i, i) and helper(chars, i, i+1) to check for odd length
 and even length palindromes, respectively. The helper function is defined below.

The helper function takes in the character array, chars, and two indices, l and r.
The indices start at the center of the possible palindrome and expand outwards until they
are out of bounds or the characters at the indices no longer match.
If the resulting substring is longer than the current longest palindromic substring,
the st and end indices are updated to reflect the new substring.

Finally, the method returns the substring of s that starts at index st and ends at index end.
The returned substring is the longest palindromic substring in the original string s.
