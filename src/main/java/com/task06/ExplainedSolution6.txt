This is a Java code for a function called "convert" that takes two inputs,
 a string "s" and an integer "numRows". The function's purpose is to convert the string "s"
 into a zigzag pattern with "numRows" rows, and return the converted string.

The first "if" statement checks if "numRows" is less than or equal to 1. If "numRows" is 1,
 it means that the zigzag pattern will have only one row, which is the same as the original string.
  In that case, the function returns the original string "s" as is.

Next, the length of the string "s" is stored in the variable "len", and the string "s" is converted
to a char array called "chars".

The variable "cycle" is set to the cycle length of each row, which is calculated as 2 times
the difference between "numRows" and 1.

A StringBuilder called "sb" is created to hold the converted string.

The first "for" loop runs through each row of the zigzag pattern. In each row,
the first character of the row is added to the "sb" StringBuilder.

The second "for" loop runs through each row of the zigzag pattern except the first and last row.
In each row, the "step" length is set to 2 times the current row number "i".
Then, the function runs through each character of the row, starting from the second character,
and adds the character to the "sb" StringBuilder. After each character is added,
the "step" length is changed to "cycle" minus the current "step" length.

The third "for" loop runs through the last row of the zigzag pattern,
and adds the last character of each row to the "sb" StringBuilder.

Finally, the "sb" StringBuilder is converted back to a string using the "toString" method
and returned as the output of the function.
