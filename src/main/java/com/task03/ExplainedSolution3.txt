This is a Java code for solving the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem.
The problem statement is to find the length of the longest substring
in a given string such that the substring does not contain any repeating characters.

The code starts with some initializations - the length of the longest substring (len),
 the previous character index (preP), and the maximum length of the substring (max).
 It then checks for an edge case where the input string is null or has a length of 0.
 If that's the case, it returns 0.

The code then initializes a hash array of size 128.
This array will be used to store the index of the last occurrence of each character in the string.
The loop then iterates through each character in the string. For each character,
it checks if the character is already present in the current substring
(by comparing the index of the last occurrence of the character with the index of the previous character).
If it is present, it updates the preP to the index of the last occurrence of the character.
 Otherwise, it updates the hash array with the index of the current character.

After updating preP and hash, the code calculates the length of the current substring (l)
and updates the max if l is greater than the current max. Finally,
the code returns the max length of the substring.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
The space complexity is O(1), since the size of the hash array is constant.
